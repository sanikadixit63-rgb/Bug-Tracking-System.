# System Flow

This document explains how the Bug Tracking System works from a user's perspective.

## User Login
A user logs into the system using their email and password.
After login, the system identifies the user's role (Admin or Developer).

## Admin Flow
- Admin accesses the Admin Dashboard.
- Admin can create new bugs by providing a title and description.
- Admin assigns bugs to developers.
- Admin can view all bugs and update their status.

## Developer Flow
- Developer accesses the Developer Dashboard.
- Developer can see only the bugs assigned to them.
- Developer updates the bug status as work progresses.

## Bug Lifecycle
- Open: Bug is created and not yet worked on.
- In Progress: Bug is currently being fixed.
- Closed: Bug has been resolved.
