# Bug-Tracking-System.



## Project Overview
This is a web-based Bug Tracking System designed to help teams record, assign, and track software bugs.

The system supports two types of users:
- Admin: manages bugs and assigns them to developers
- Developer: works on assigned bugs and updates their status

Each bug goes through a simple lifecycle: Open → In Progress → Closed.
The application focuses on clarity, role-based access, and structured tracking of issues.
